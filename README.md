##1. Classification Methodology##
**Project Bethesda Dataset**
   
The DataSet contains Medline Metadata from 2100 Articles categorized  by Dr. Benjamin Solomon head of Genomics at Inova ITMI
   - **Dataset Composition** 
      - Articles correspond to 140 Genes
      - 15 Articles per a Gene 
      - 5 Articles per a research type per a Gene.
      
- **Abstract Normalization**
   - Convert all text to lowercase 
   - Remove Stopwords from NLTK Stopwords Corpus
   - Remove Standalone numbers (1, 2, 3 but not brca1)
   - Remove Number Words (one,two, three)
   - Remove Punctuation (periods, commas, etc)

- **Feature Selection**
  - Prepend the Title, Authors,  Journal Title Abbreviation, Publication Type to the abstract
  - Use the Azure ML feature hashing module with n-grams of 4 and a Hashing Bitsize of 15
  - Convert ResearchPhase into a TwoClassLabel

- **Model Selection and Parameters**
  - Combine a two-class Boosted Decison Tree with a One vs All Classifer
    - Max of 32 Leaves Per a Tree
    - Min of 50 instances per a Leaf
    - Learning Rate of 0.2
    - 100 Trees

##2. Performance Benchmarks##

Using a randomized test/train split of 70-30 here is the average run result:

 - 0 = Basic Science Articles
 - 1 = Clinical Articles 
 - 2 = Managed Articles
